The two images I used:

I thought that a robot would be an interesting shirt idea since we are currently taking applied machine learning and will soon learn about artifical intelligence in ethics. I picked the image of the water and sunset because the still water reminded me of calmness and serenity. This summer was very busy and I thought that choosing this image would remind me to relax and take a step back to experience the nature and warm weather.
