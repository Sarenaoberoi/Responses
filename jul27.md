I predicted the population of 5 different images.

This first image showed a very forresty area. The model predicted a population of 38.8057289.

This second image also showed a very forrestry area. The model predicted a population of 7.95019

This third image showed a couple houses. The model predicted a population of 50.004032. This number makes the most sense because we would expect there to be more people in neighborhoods.

This image showed a number of trees. The population predicted for this image was 9.50581

This last image showed a couple hosues (similar to image number 3). The model predicted a poulation of 27.415765. 

This model worked pretty well
