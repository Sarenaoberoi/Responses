Maroney Lecture #1

1) In the first episode of Laurence Maroney's, Machine Learning, Maroney expands on the difference between traditional programming and machine learning. He explains that with traditional programming, The user will input data and rules (which are made up of code) and the output will be in the form of answers (code). With machine learning, the user will input answers and data, and the program will be able to define the rules. This is different from traditional programming, in that with machine learning, the computer/program will be able to define the rules as the output, while traditional programming requires the user to enter the rules as an input. 

2) The first time I ran the predict line with value '7', I received an output of 22.002316. The second time I ran the predict line with the same value, I received an output value of 22.00009. Every time the code runs, it goes through a loop that begins at the loss (how much error was in that guess) and then goes back to the optimizer to produce another guess. Following this, the optimizer value will go back to the loss and determine the amount of error in that guess. This loop continues to go on: loss to optimizer and so on.
