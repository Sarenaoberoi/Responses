Maroney Lecture #1

1) In the first episode of Laurence Maroney's, Machine Learning, Maroney expands on the difference between traditional programming and machine learning. He explains that with traditional programming, The user will input data and rules (which are made up of code) and the output will be in the form of answers (code). With machine learning, the user will input answers and data, and the program will be able to define the rules. This is different from traditional programming, in that with machine learning, the computer/program will be able to define the rules as the output, while traditional programming requires the user to enter the rules as an input.
